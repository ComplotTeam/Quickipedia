# Quickipedia - Project Vision and Planning

## Overview
In an era where attention spans are shrinking and the digital world is evolving rapidly, Quickipedia emerges as a tool designed specifically for the young and dynamic.
Born from the minds of two Gen Z creators, Quickipedia is more than just an app - it's a gateway to quick, engaging, and informative content.

To cater to the unique needs of individuals aged 6-30, providing a platform that aligns with their digital fluency and fast-paced lifestyles.
We understand that for our generation, time is of the essence. That's why Quickipedia is optimized for mobile use, ensuring that knowledge is not just accessible but also concise and visually appealing.

Drawing inspiration from the viral trend of short-form videos, Quickipedia offers a similar approach to information consumption. Our platform is designed to capture and retain the attention of our users through bite-sized, yet substantial content.
